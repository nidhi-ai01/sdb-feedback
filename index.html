    <p>
      <em><strong>She Deserves the Best</strong></em> is more than a novel—  
      it's a piece of my heart,  
      stitched with <span style="color: #c44569; font-weight: 600;">quiet ache</span>,  
      <span style="color: #c44569; font-weight: 600;">raw truths</span>, and  
      the <span style="color: #c44569; font-weight: 600;">soft courage to heal</span>.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      It was born from silent tears, late-night thoughts, and the unspoken battles so many carry within.  
      Through Sanya’s journey, I wanted to give voice to the emotions we’re often told to hide—  
      grief, loneliness, longing, and the soft magic of friendship.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      To every girl who has ever felt <strong>unseen</strong>, <strong>unheard</strong>, or <strong>unloved</strong>:  
      this story is for <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">you</span>.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      You deserve to be held.  
      You deserve to be heard.  
      You deserve to be loved—  
      <span style="color: #c44569; font-weight: 600;">gently</span>,  
      <span style="color: #c44569; font-weight: 600;">wholly</span>,  
      and without conditions.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
      Thank you for picking up this book.  
      I hope it feels like a <strong style="color: #c44569;">warm hug</strong> on your hardest days.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 2rem; text-align: right; font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; font-size: 1.5rem;">
