## 📌 About the Novel

> *"She loved quietly. She broke silently. She rose, finally."*

**Sanya** never asked for much — just peace, space, and someone who’d stay. But when love became tangled in expectations and friendship dissolved into emotional chaos, she found herself caught between holding on and letting go.

In a world that glorifies strength but silences softness, Sanya’s journey is one of heartbreak, silence, rediscovery, and self-worth.

> **She Deserves the Best** is for anyone who’s ever been told they’re *“too much” or “not enough.”*  
> This story is for you.  
> You deserve the best. Always.
